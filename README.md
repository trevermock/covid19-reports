## Description

Web app for visualizing Covid-19 data generated by [mysymptoms.mil](https://www.mysymptoms.mil).

## Running

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Development

This project was bootstrapped with [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), and uses
[rescripts](https://github.com/harrysolovay/rescripts) to customize the build configuration.

As the project requirements grow, we may need to eject from create-react-app/rescripts. However, they greatly simplify
management of the build configuration, so we should avoid ejecting if possible.

## Testing

```
npm test
```
